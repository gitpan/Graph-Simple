Renamed to Graph::Simple:

2004-12-29 v0.03 Tels 52 tests
  * is a subclass of Graph::Directed, so add it as prereq again :Â°)

  * Graph::Layout::Simple::Edge - an edge between two nodes
  * Graph: added node() -  find node by name
  * Graph: add quite some more documentation
  * Graph, Node: added as_txt()
  * Node: added incoming(), and track incoming edges from other nodes
  * added t/parser.t - test text parser
  * added t/ascii.t - parse various text files to ascii

2005-01-03 v0.04 Tels 84 tests
  * change code to work with Graph 0.50
  * require Graph 0.50
  * added: Group.pm -- a group of nodes
  * added: examples/html.pl, examples/common.pl and TODO
  * tests: use strict;, add t/edge.t
  * Parser: document the different edge directions and styles
  * Parser: construct edges with the proper style
  * Parser: allow '..>' style
  * Node: 
    + document successorts()/predecessors(), as_txt(), as_html()
    + implement as_html($tag)
  * Graph:
    + _trace_path() can also trace short, straight paths upwards
    + as_txt() uses $edge->as_txt() to render edge
    + as_ascii() generates proper output for edges with the right style
    + as_ascii() no longer generates trailing whitespace on lines
    + add css(), as_html_page(), html_page_footer(), html_page_header()
