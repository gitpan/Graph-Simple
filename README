Graph-Simple
============

This module let's you create graphs (nodes/vertices connected by edges/arcs,
not pie charts!) and then lay them out on a flat surface.

Once laid out, the graph can be converted into various output formats like
ASCII art or HTML.

Graphs can be generated by Perl code, or parsed from a simple text format
that describes the graph.

For instance this input:

	[ Bonn ] -> [ Berlin ]
	[ Berlin -> [ Frankfurt ] { border: 1px dotted black; }
	[ Frankfurt ] -> [ Dresden ]
	[ Berlin ] -> [ Potsdam ]
	[ Potsdam ] => [ Cottbus ]

would be rendered in ASCII as:

	+------+     +--------+      .............     +---------+
	| Bonn | --> | Berlin |  --> : Frankfurt : --> | Dresden |
	+------+     +--------+      .............     +---------+
	               |
	               |
	               v
	             +---------+     +---------+
	             | Potsdam | ==> | Cottbus |
	             +---------+     +---------+

The HTML output would look similiar except be more pretty :o)

Examples
========

Run the following examples:

ASCII output
------------

	perl examples/ascii.pl

HTML output
-----------

Open test.html afterwards in your favourite browser:

	perl examples/html.pl >test.html
