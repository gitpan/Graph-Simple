Graph-Simple
============

See Graph::Simple under LIMITATIONS for some hot topics. Also:

* _trace_path()
* find place for nodes by walking in increasing circles around the source
  node
* Graph: as_txt() needs to quote special chars in node names

* HTML/CSS: class names should contain the graph-id, this makes it possible
  to generate more than one graph in one page
