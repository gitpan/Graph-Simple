Graph-Simple
============

See Graph::Simple under LIMITATIONS for some hot topics. Also:

* _trace_path() for bend edges
* find place for nodes by walking in increasing circles around the source
  node
* parser: deal with " [ node ], [node2], [node3]"
* when generating HTML tables, trailing <td></td> pairs could be stripped
* we need only to output the node attributes in as_txt when we
  output the node the first time
* output general class attributes fails for sub-classes like "node.city"
  (it seems it needs to repeat all settings from "node", too)
