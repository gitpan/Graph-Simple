Graph-Simple
============

See Graph::Simple under LIMITATIONS for some hot topics.

In addition:

* the ASCII outut is broken for t/stress/0004.txt - check and fix
* _trace_path() for bend edges (with one corner; and if X1 == X2 or
  Y1 == Y2, bend around two corners (U shaped))
* _trace_path(): use A* algorithmn as last resort to find path
* find place for nodes by walking in increasing circles around the source
  node
* parser: deal with " [ node ], [node2], [node3]"
* parser: deal with optional attributes after an edge
* when generating HTML tables, trailing <td></td> pairs could be stripped
* add our format to Graph::ReadWrite
